# IPBanProSDK
This is the C# / .NET Core IPBan Pro API and Applications Integration. Use this code to bind to the IPBan Pro API and web admin utility.

In order to build and run you need to also place IPBan in a sibling folder (https://github.com/DigitalRuby/IPBan). Eventually this will be a nuget package link.
